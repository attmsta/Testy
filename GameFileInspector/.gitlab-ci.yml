      - **Architecture**: Universal (ARM64, ARM32, x86_64)

      ### 🔧 Technical Details
      - Built with Gradle $($(cd $PROJECT_SUBDIR && ./gradlew --version) | grep 'Gradle' | head -1 | cut -d' ' -f2)
      - Kotlin with modern Android patterns
      - Material Design 3 UI
      - Comprehensive error handling and validation

      ### 📥 Installation
