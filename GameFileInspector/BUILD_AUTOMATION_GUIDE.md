# üöÄ Build Automation Guide

## Overview

This guide covers the comprehensive build automation system for Game File Inspector, including CI/CD pipelines, local build scripts, and release management.

## üîÑ Automated Build Workflows

This project uses **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD. The workflow is defined in `.github/workflows/build-and-release.yml`.

### GitHub Actions Workflow (`.github/workflows/build-and-release.yml`)

The GitHub Actions workflow provides comprehensive automated building, testing, and releasing, deeply integrated with GitHub.

#### Workflow Jobs
The workflow consists of several key jobs:
1.  **`test`**: Runs unit tests and lint checks on the codebase. This ensures code quality and catches regressions early.
2.  **`build-debug`**: Compiles a debug version of the APK. This is typically run on pull requests and pushes to non-main branches to verify build integrity.
3.  **`build-release`**: Compiles a release version of the APK (unsigned). This is run on pushes to the `main` branch and when tags are created.
4.  **`create-release`**: Automatically creates a GitHub Release when changes are pushed to the `main` branch or a tag is created. This job downloads the release APK from `build-release` and attaches it to the GitHub Release, along with generated release notes.

*(Note: The workflow may include additional jobs for security scanning, performance analysis, etc., as configured in the YAML file.)*

#### Key Features & Advanced Capabilities
- ‚úÖ **Automatic APK Building**: Triggered on pushes to `main`, `develop`, tags (`v*`), pull requests to `main`, scheduled nightly builds, and manual dispatches.
- ‚úÖ **Comprehensive Testing**: Includes unit tests and lint analysis.
- ‚úÖ **Artifact Management**: APKs and test results are stored as artifacts with configurable retention.
- ‚úÖ **Automated GitHub Releases**: New releases are automatically drafted or published with APKs and detailed release notes.
- ‚úÖ **Security Scanning**: (If configured) Checks for hardcoded secrets, permission issues, etc.
- ‚úÖ **Performance Analysis**: (If configured) Monitors APK size and other performance metrics.
- üéØ **Smart Triggering**: Builds and releases are triggered based on branch names (e.g., `main`, `develop`), event types (push, pull_request, tag), and file changes.
- üéØ **Artifact Caching**: Utilizes caching for Gradle dependencies (`~/.gradle/caches`, `~/.gradle/wrapper`, `GameFileInspector/.gradle`) to speed up build times. The cache key is based on OS and hash of Gradle files.
- üéØ **Multi-job Parallelization**: Jobs can run in parallel where appropriate to improve CI/CD efficiency.
- üéØ **Conditional Execution**: Jobs and steps can be run conditionally (e.g., `build-release` runs on `main` or tags, `create-release` depends on specific conditions).
- üéØ **Release Management**: Automatic versioning and release note generation are part of the `create-release` job.

#### Accessing Build Artifacts and Logs
- **Build Logs**: Available directly within the "Actions" tab of the GitHub repository. Each workflow run shows detailed logs for every step.
- **APKs**:
    - Debug APKs are uploaded as artifacts in the `build-debug` job runs.
    - Release APKs are uploaded as artifacts in the `build-release` job runs.
    - Release APKs are also attached to GitHub Releases created by the `create-release` job.
- **Test Reports**: Uploaded as artifacts in the `test` job runs.

## üõ†Ô∏è Local Build Script (`build_apk.sh`)

### Features
The local build script provides comprehensive APK building capabilities:

```bash
# Basic usage
./build_apk.sh                    # Build debug APK
./build_apk.sh -t release         # Build release APK
./build_apk.sh -c -t release      # Clean build release APK
./build_apk.sh -t debug -i        # Build and install debug APK
```

### Command Line Options
| Option | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `-t, --type` | Build type (debug/release) | `-t release` |
| `-c, --clean` | Clean build artifacts | `-c` |
| `--no-tests` | Skip running tests | `--no-tests` |
| `-i, --install` | Install APK after building | `-i` |
| `-d, --device` | Show connected devices | `-d` |
| `-h, --help` | Show help message | `-h` |

### Build Process
1. **Environment Validation** - Check Java, Android SDK, Gradle
2. **Dependency Resolution** - Download and cache dependencies
3. **Testing** (optional) - Run unit tests and lint checks
4. **Compilation** - Build APK with specified configuration
5. **Analysis** - APK size analysis and optimization suggestions
6. **Installation** (optional) - Install on connected devices
7. **Reporting** - Generate detailed build report

### Build Report Generation
The script generates comprehensive build reports:
```

## üì¶ Release Management

### Automatic Release Creation

#### GitHub Releases
- **Trigger**: Configured within the GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/build-and-release.yml`). Typically on pushes to the `main` branch or when new tags (e.g., `v1.0.0`) are pushed. Can also be triggered manually via `workflow_dispatch`.
- **Assets**: The workflow uploads the release APK (e.g., `app-release-unsigned.apk`) and a versioned copy (e.g., `GameFileInspector-v<SHA>.apk`) to the GitHub Release.
- **Versioning**: The `create-release` job in the workflow generates a version name. If triggered by a tag, it uses the tag name. Otherwise, it might use a date-based version with a commit SHA.
- **Release Notes**: Automatically generated as part of the `create-release` job, summarizing features and build information.
- **Access**: Releases are available under the "Releases" section of the GitHub repository.

### Release Artifacts
Each release includes:
- üì± **Release APK** - Optimized production build
- üì± **Debug APK** - Development build with debugging enabled
- üìä **Build Reports** - Comprehensive build and test results
- üìù **Release Notes** - Feature descriptions and change logs
- üîç **Security Reports** - Security analysis results

## üîß Build Configuration

### Gradle Configuration
The build system uses Gradle 8.2 with optimized settings:

```gradle
android {
    compileSdk 34
    
    defaultConfig {
        applicationId "com.gamefileinspector"
        minSdk 24
        targetSdk 34
        versionCode 1
        versionName "1.0"
    }
    
    buildTypes {
        debug {
            debuggable true
            minifyEnabled false
            applicationIdSuffix ".debug"
        }
        
        release {
            minifyEnabled true
            proguardFiles getDefaultProguardFile('proguard-android-optimize.txt'), 'proguard-rules.pro'
            signingConfig signingConfigs.debug // For unsigned builds
        }
    }
}
```

# Configure signing in build.gradle
android {
    signingConfigs {
        release {
            storeFile file('release-key.keystore')
            storePassword System.getenv('KEYSTORE_PASSWORD')
            keyAlias 'release'
            keyPassword System.getenv('KEY_PASSWORD')
        }
    }
}
```
