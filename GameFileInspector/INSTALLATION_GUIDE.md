## üéØ Tips for Success

### Finding Game Values

#### Currency (Gold, Coins, Gems)
1. Note your current currency amount in-game
2. Analyze save files immediately after checking
3. Look for exact matches or nearby values
4. Test modifications with small amounts first

#### Experience Points
1. Check XP before and after gaining experience
2. Look for values that match the difference
3. Experience is often stored as total, not level

#### Level/Progress
1. Level values are usually small integers (1-100)
2. Progress might be stored as percentages (0-100)
3. Some games store level as experience thresholds

### Best Practices

#### Safety First
- **Always backup** before making changes
- **Test with small values** before large modifications
- **Keep original values** noted somewhere safe
- **Restore immediately** if game becomes unstable

#### Effective Modification
- **Make realistic changes** to avoid detection
- **Modify one value at a time** for testing
- **Restart the game** after modifications
- **Check if changes persist** after game restart

#### Troubleshooting
- **Game crashes**: Restore from backup immediately
- **Values reset**: Game may have server validation
- **Can't find files**: Check if game stores data externally
- **Permission denied**: Ensure storage permissions are granted

## üö´ Limitations & Warnings

### Technical Limitations
- **Root access not available**: Cannot modify system-protected files
- **Encrypted files**: Cannot modify encrypted or obfuscated data
- **Server-side validation**: Online games may reset modified values
- **Anti-cheat systems**: Some games detect file modifications

### Legal and Ethical Considerations
- **Terms of Service**: Modifying games may violate ToS
- **Online games**: May result in account suspension
